# Freelance iOS Development

I was able to make money creating a prototype app for a mutual friend.  It was very exciting to be able to make something someone paid for and is actually going to use.  I asked the employer for a testimonial and this is what he said: 

“Trent was very responsive and friendly to work with. I sent over some basic ideas / designs in excel and a word document, which he was able to discern and translate into a working version of an iOS app. He communicated well and was very willing to go above and beyond.”
